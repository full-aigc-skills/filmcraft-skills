# FilmCraft Public Runtime Sequence First Use and Effect Handoff

## State and authority

Existing OpenSpec FC-DM-001-SEQUENCE remains authoritative. Maintained native CLI `0.2.0-craft.2` is publicly prereleased. All eleven source skills lock the same archive, binary and provenance digests. Existing immutable releases remain intact. Plugin snapshot updates, installed-release acceptance and Art mixed handoff remain pending.

## Installation and execution

    E[Single Effect export skill] --> R[Public native CLI renders RGBA frames]
    R --> S[Manifest and every frame digest]
    S --> F[Single Film media skill]
    F --> B[Unchanged installer downloads craft.2]
    B --> I[Explicit-rate import and complete collection]
    I --> V[Native MP4 and independent decode]
    V --> M[Relink moved package and revise locally]
```

Tests copy only their respective skills into isolated `.agents/skills`, start with absent runtime directories, preserve real installers and public HTTPS downloads, and check archive, binary, PROVENANCE and version. The single-domain test also checks reuse. The two-domain test consumes actual Effect rendering instead of a still or synthetic sequence. Command references are regenerated from the verified craft.2 native catalogue while retaining each scenario's existing command selection. Catalogue presence is not scenario acceptance.

## Evidence

- [Public native cold installation](evidence/sequence-public-runtime-first-use-20261006.json): twelve frames at 12 fps, one-second duration, complete collection, revision after moving delivery and deleting inputs, unchanged old package and skill bytes, corrupt-frame rejection, and independently decoded MP4 with twelve original frames and thirteen after a one-frame move. One test passed.
- [Effect to Film](evidence/effect-film-sequence-handoff-20261006.json): one copied skill per domain, empty runtime and two public CLI downloads, actual twelve-frame transparent animation consumed by Film, independent frame-count/background/graphic-color checks, Effect text revision, moved Film package and deleted original intro directory, targeted replacement preserving background, initial frame and old delivery. One test passed.
- Updated ordinary audio/caption/single-shot revision regression: one passed. All eight task-skill cold-install regressions passed. Default source tests: 43 passed, 19 environment-gated skips.

## Remaining boundaries

This proves source-skill first use with publicly distributed native runtimes. It does not prove immutable new skill/plugin installation, Art sequence dependencies or selective revision, full creative quality, color fidelity, GUI or all platforms. Task 4.31 remains open and the release remains developmental.

## Installed fixed-plugin acceptance

[Installed evidence](evidence/codex-filmcraft10-sequence-first-use-20261006.json): Codex 0.153.4 installs immutable Film dev.10 (skills dev.9) in isolation, alongside unchanged Effect dev.8, Photo dev.10, Vector dev.11 and Art dev.63. All 58 skills are discovered with zero loading errors. The actually installed media skill starts with an empty runtime directory and completes public download, native sequence creation, complete collection, moved-project revision, corrupt-frame rejection and independent MP4 decode: one passed. All 58 installed skill identities remain intact after execution. This closes the bounded Film installed-release check, not Effect's new sequence snapshot, Art dynamic integration, actual Skills CLI installation or model dispatch; task 4.31 stays open.
